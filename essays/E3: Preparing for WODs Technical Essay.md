  The last WOD that was due before this essay was <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">Invoice1</a>. In this WOD we were tasked to create a sales receipt for a sale that contained five different products. We could not "hard code" the data but rather use expressions and variables to compute them. There were eleven different tasks that we followed to create the sales receipt. It took me about thirty minutes to complete. In my experience in performing this WOD, what worked well for me was tasks one through four. I was able to perform these tasks without help. I could create the different variables in their corresponding areas and compute the extended prices and subtotal. Doing these tasks were pretty straight forward because I was familiar with these actions. I slowed me down was task five. I could not figure out how to calculate sales tax because I was using 5.75% instead of 0.0575%. This was a mistake that was quickly fixed. After this tasks six through eigth went smoothly. However what slowed me down was creating the table. At first I was creating my own table but then I remebered that I could go into the source code of the website and use the table there. After this I struggled with the rest of the taks. I understood a little of how to use document.write() but I was doing things in the wrong order. I then used the example screencast for help. What I did to prepare for this WOD was looking over all the steps and reading them carefully. I also watched this module's screencast and did the readings. For the WODS before this I followed similar preparations. What I did differently was looking back at the readings. What I could have done to be better prepared for this WOD is understanding the coding more. I struggled with the non hard coding so it would have been better to understand it more. For the next WODs I will apply this preparation.
