I chose MIS because I have always been interested in the advancement of technology.Throughout my life, I have been exposed to many different technology advancements. For example, I saw the television go from a big piece of metal to a skinny piece of glass. I have seen technology change rapidly and I want to be a part of that. I was attracted to the MIS program because I wanted to further my understanding of how information technologies can change and grow a business. 

This is my third year here at UHM studying MIS. I expect to graduate in Spring 2024. I am excited to learn more about what the MIS program has to offer.
