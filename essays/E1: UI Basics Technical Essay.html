    For the first three WODs of this class I had a hard time. In the first WOD we mainly focused on creating and formatting a webpage. In the second WOD we used CSS to style our webpage by adding different fonts, sizing, and adding colors. In the third WOD, we learned how to change the format of the webpage by changing how the information is placed. 
  </p>
<p>
  In the first WOD, I approached it by walking through it myself without a timer because I knew that I was not going to finish in time. Since I am still a novice coder, I read the instructions thoroughly making sure I did not miss a step. I did everything myself up until I got stuck at the linking portion. Here I watched the demonstration video to clear up my confusion. I followed the steps done in the demonstration making sure I understood each step. After finishing the webpage with the demonstration video, I felt confident enough to do it on my own. It took me four attempts to finally finish within the time limit. Overall, the first WOD was a struggle but I got through it with persistence and patience. 
  </p>
<p>
  In the second WOD, I took the same approach as I did in the first one. I walked through it myself at first without a timer. I attempted to do it by myself up until the linking portion. I did not understand how to link the style.css file to index.html. I then watched demonstration video and followed along to complete the tasks given. After doing this I felt confident enough to attempt with a timer. This WOD took me two attempts to finish. At first I finished at the Sd time but I felt like I could do faster. On my second attempt I was able to get a Rx time because I knew what I was doing.
  </p>
<p> 
  In the third WOD, I completely did not know what I was doing so I watched and followed the demonstration video. After realizing how simple this WOD was I then attempted with a timer. This WOD felt easier than the last two because I started to understand coding more. This WOD took me two attempts to finish. In my first attempt I got stuck at the navigation bar part so I restarted. In my second attempt I finsihed all the tasks smoothly getting a Rx time. 
  </p>
<p>
  After completeing the first three WODs of this class, I feel more confident in my coding ability. I now have a better understanding of the basic structures of HTML, CSS, and basic web page design. I also learned how to utilize tools to develop code more efficiently. After completeing the first WOD, the second and third felt a little more natural. For me, I just had to get over the hump of understanding what each code means and how it can change the information in the code. For the future, I will continue to use what I learned in these WODs to work more efficiently. I should have used a better a screen recording because there were times it crashed on me and I had start over again. Overall, the first three WODs were informational and fun to do.
